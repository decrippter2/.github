# Overview

This is the organizational page for the decRiPPter2 software and affiliated work.

decRiPPter2 is a tool to detect ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters from genomic data. It works by *de novo* detection, which allows it to detect RiPPs rule-independently.

decRiPPter2 is a complete rework of the original decRiPPter software by [Kloosterman et al](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001026), which has since been retired. This organization is not affiliated with decRiPPter and does not share a codebase.
